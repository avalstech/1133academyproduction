# 1133 Academy Frontend (Vite + React + Tailwind + shadcn-ui)

This is a production-ready **frontend** generated from your existing 1133 Academy HTML content and rebuilt as a modern React SPA.

## Tech
- Vite + React + TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- shadcn-ui style components (local)
- React Router

## Pages
- Home (`/`)
- Services (`/services`)
- Blog (`/blog`)
- About (`/about`)
- Events (`/events`)
- Contact (`/contact`)

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Notes
- The contact and subscribe forms are frontend-only placeholders. Wire them to your backend (API / email provider) when ready.
- Replace placeholder map/video embeds with your real links.
- Update the LinkedIn URL in the footer when you have it.
